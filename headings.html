    <h1>A story</h1>
        <h2>The beginning</h2>
            <p>The story starts with several characters.</p>
        <h2>The middle</h2>
            <h3>Plot plot plot!</h3>
                <p>This is the part of the story where, presumably, something happens.</p>
            <h3>Psychological excavation</h3>
                <p>Some stories don't really have plots, but a lot of "character development."</p>
        <h2>The end</h2>
                <p>Things are supposed to get neat and tidy here or go out with a bang but often just end in impasse.</p>
