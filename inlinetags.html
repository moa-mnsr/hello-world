        <title>To be loved!</title>

        <p>Everyone wishes to be loved, but, in the event, <strong>nearly no one can bear it.</strong> Everyone desires love but also finds it impossible to believe that he deserves it.</p>

        <p>However great the private disasters to which love may lead, <em>love itself is strikingly and mysteriously impersonal;</em> it is a reality which is not altered by anything one does. Therefore, one does many things, turns the key in the lock over and over again, hoping to be locked out.</p> 

        <p>Once locked out, one will never again be forced to encounter in the eyes of a stranger who loves him the impenetrable truth concerning the stranger, <sup>oneself,</sup> who is loved.</p>

        <p>And yet -- one would prefer, after all, <sub>not to be</sub> locked out. One would prefer, merely, that the key unlocked a less stunningly unusual door.</p>
